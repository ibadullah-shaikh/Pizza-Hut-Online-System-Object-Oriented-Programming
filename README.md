# Pizza-Hut-Online-System-Using-C++
This is a small project made by students of FAST University,Karachi,Pakistan. Here we have used basic concepts of OOP in C++ language and designed a system which tracks sales per day of all pizzas sold. Moreover, one can also signup for membership to get discounts. Midnight deals are also available after 12:00 AM and ends before 6:00 AM. We have made different branches of Pizza hut and we have made admin of each branch so they can check performance of their respective branch and a Manager who have all administrative function. Manager can check sales of all branch per day, combine sale of all three branches per day and total revenue made by all Branches up to date. we are also looking for future work on this project. Future Work Includes: The future work that could be done on this project is to implement this all logic with GUI. All different branches would have different menus and we will add items other than Pizzas. More functions for manager like to add a new branch, new admin, replace an admin. More Functions for Admin like to add more items to menu or remove an item from menu. Please Contribute.
